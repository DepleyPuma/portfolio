This site is a showcase of my capabilities - I demonstrate what a well-done project should look like on the web. I have over a year of commercial experience, but I've been coding much longer than that. What sets me apart? Realism and partnership approach.

		"intro": "Hi, I'm Szymon – a front-end developer with a passion for code, aesthetics, and... physical fitness.",
		"daily": "Every day, I design and build modern websites – ones that not only look good but also run fast, intuitively, and without compromise. I love combining logic with creativity – it's that mix that got me hooked on web development.",
		"lifestyle": "But my life isn’t just digital. I’ve been a volunteer firefighter for years – a role that taught me responsibility, pressure management, and teamwork. On top of that, I train regularly – the gym is like a second home to me, and I go there up to 5 times a week. I care about my body because physical fitness isn’t just about looks – it’s about energy, discipline, and health, all of which influence how I work.",
		"hobbies": "After hours, I enjoy editing videos – sometimes for myself, sometimes for friends with a vision. It’s my creative break from code and a great exercise in attention to detail.",
		"approach": "In work, I focus on quality, a realistic approach, and a true partnership. I don’t make empty promises – instead, I deliver solid solutions, clear communication, and full engagement from start to finish.",
		"closing": "If you're looking for someone who not only knows front-end but also has clear priorities and knows how to get things done – feel free to reach out."
